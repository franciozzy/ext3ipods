 Description:
  This project implements a copy of Linux Extended 3 Filesystem with
  added QoS extensions. It is the prototype of Felipe Franciosi's PhD
  thesis "Data Management Strategies for Relative Quality of Service
  in Virtualised Storage Systems". See the URL below for more details.

 Contents:
  ifm_lkm
    This is the online filesystem manager. A loadable kernel module
    that finds a mounted ext3ipods filesystem and provides a set of
    functionalities for the management of QoS attributes.

  ext3ipods <not yet present>
    This is the implementation of the ext3ipods filesystem.

  e2fsprogs-1.41.12-ipods
    This is a modified version of e2fsprogs with added support for
    the management of QoS flags in inodes (and removed ext4fs support).

  ipods-visualiser <not yet present>
    This is a collection of tools to visualise data allocation
    quality in different ways (data layout bitmaps, reports, etc).
